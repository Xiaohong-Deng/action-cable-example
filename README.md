## A simple chat room app for practice

Inspired by the article [Real-Time Rails: Implementing WebSockets in Rails 5 with Action Cable](https://blog.heroku.com/real_time_rails_implementing_websockets_in_rails_5_with_action_cable)

This chat room app can handle multiple chat rooms. Users can enter anyone of them and send messages in it. The messages sent will only be shown to users in the room at the moment. All the past messages are saved and will be shown to users who just got into the room.
